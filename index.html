		<h1>JavaScript Security</h1>
		<p>
			In JavaScript our code can become compromised on either the client side or
			server side if we do not take the right security measures. There are some
			common attacks that can happen on client and server side. Because frontend
			JavaScirpt code is viewable by all users on a browser code can become
			vulnerable to scripting and forgery attacks if we leave our code
			vulnerable to such attacks. One general rule of thumb is to not store any
			confidential user information or backend data e.g. customer payment info,
			database crednetials. as users can read the source JavaScript code on the
			browser and therfore see this information.
		</p>
		<h3>Cross-Site Scripting Attacks (XSS)</h3>
		<p>
			Cross-Site Scripting Attacks (XSS) is an attack pattern of injecting and
			executing malicious JavaScript code on your app. This is a very dangerous
			attack as the attacker can inject any JavaScript code such as reading from
			a users browser storage, sending them to a different url, sending a
			network reqeust that isnt part of the original app or sending malicious
			code to be stored on the backend/database that could be executed later. A
			common example of injecting JavaScript is by executing a script or piece
			of JavaScirpt code in a place where innerHTML is going to be rendered. For
			example a form may take in information from an input and render it using
			innerHTML but an attacker could use that form to send a script to execute
			as that script would then be added as legitimate HTML and execute. A way
			to fix this and prevent such JavaScript injection is to remove any uses of
			innerHTML and replace them with textContent that way anything entered is
			rendered as a string and cant be added as HTML such as a script to be
			executed. Another common fix approach is to sanitize all innerHTML before
			it is added, there are libraries that will do this for you and go through
			your innerHTML and sanitize it removing any JavaScript code so it cant be
			injected and executed.
